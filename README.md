As part of completing a track in Developing AI Applications / Associate AI Engineer for Developers on DataCamp, this was one of the optional projects that they had on their website which I used as practice for calling the OpenAI API 
and creating a chatbot using prompt engineering.

It took about an hour and it was very satisfying when the chatbot ran with the suggestions!

The code runs through a set loop of three questions that are appended to the next query to retain chatbot memory of the conversation.
